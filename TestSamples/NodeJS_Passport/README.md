Test sample by Brecht Carlier.

I created this to play around with NodeJS Passport functionality.

I'm able to login...
Which is nice :)

##TODO:

Basically everthing :)

- Sign up (add users)
- Logout
- Add encryption (plaintext is for the weak)
- Add authentication on crucial places! (normal people don't need access to our json files)
