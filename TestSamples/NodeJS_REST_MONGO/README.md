# NodeJS REST / MONGO

Test sample by Brecht Carlier.
I created this to play around with NodeJS.

I'm able to get the Questions in json format from the MongoDB

By using AJAX, I'm able to put the data in my html file.
Used ACE editor to post answers.

This is a first test. Nothing real yet.
This solution uses Monk to talk with db instead of Mongoose.

Used Tiles for buttons, I personnaly like it :)

TODO:

- Users: Post answers / edit them
- Admin: Make questions / Edit questions
- Change to Mongoose
