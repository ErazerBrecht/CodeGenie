# NodeJS REST / MONGO

Test sample by Brecht Carlier.
Later edited by Matthew Berkvens.

I created this to play around with NodeJS.

I'm able to get, post and edit the Users, Exercises and Answers in json format from the online database.


By using AJAX, I'm able to put the data in my html file.
Used ACE editor to post answers.

This solution uses the Mongoose library to talk to the online Database.

Used Tiles for buttons, I personally like it :)

TODO:

- User authorization
- Sessions
- Authorization checks on each function
