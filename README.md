# Project Cloud Applications CodeGenie
TODO: Write summary about project...

The idea of this project is invented by Tim Dams.

He wanted a platform that he could use for the labo's of his programming courses. This platform will be used as an exercise panel. The admin has the possiblity to add exercises. The users can solve this exercises. After this the admin can revise this answers with points.
The idea is that the student will be more enthousiast to make extra exercises.

There will be statistics so the admin can follow the activity of the users, the users will also be possible to view their own progression. 

At a later stage it would be nice if we have an autocorrect. If this works, we have made our own capture the flag software.
